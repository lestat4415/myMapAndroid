# GeomaticApp
Geomatic application with Jetpack Compose and MVVM architecture

# API_KEY_VALUE
On manifest you must replace
```ruby
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="<YOUR_API_KEY"/>'
```
The value on this project were deleted so this API_KEY will not work when you try to compilate
